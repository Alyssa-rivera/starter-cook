It doesn&#8217;t matter who you are or how tough you&#8217;re acting, the idea of millions of people dying from a disease with no vaccination or cure to is scary – and we bet you&#8217;re feeling a bit helpless.</p><p>Truth is though, you&#8217;re not. We here at Metro Parent have seen tons of tiny acts of kindness in our community and you can be a part of that, despite the fact that we&#8217;re all stuck at home.</p><p>Curious what you can do? Here&#8217;s a list of six easy ways you can help out your community from home – or close to home while abiding by the CDC&#8217;s guidelines to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19.</p><h3>Crafting for hospitals</h3><div style='margin:5px auto; margin-bottom: 15px;' id='zone_load_853505285'><broadstreet-zone callback="zone_load_853505285" zone-id="80371" keywords="not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,coronavirus-help,health-fitness,parenting-issues-tips,parenting,ways-to-help-out-your-community-at-home,post" soft-keywords="true" zone-alias=""></broadstreet-zone></div> <p>Hospitals are in dire need of a number of items including protective face masks. If you&#8217;re a crafter with fabric lying around, consider making some washable facemasks to donate to your local hospital. Just make sure they are CDC compliant, which according to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ClevelandSewingCompany/posts/1972827919528280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Cleveland Sewing Company</a>, means you need two layers made of 100% cotton.</p><p>Too much pressure? Hospitals are also in need of blankets. Check out this Make a <a href="https://fleeceandthankyou.org/product/blanket-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Blanket Kit from Fleece &amp; Thank You</a> for more info on how to craft those.</p><div class="td-a-rec td-a-rec-id-content_inline tdi_73_f8a td_block_template_1"><style>.tdi_73_f8a.td-a-rec-img,.tdi_73_f8a .td-adspot-title{text-align:left}.tdi_73_f8a.td-a-rec-img img{margin:0 auto 0 0}.tdi_73_f8a .td-element-style{z-index:-1}</style><span class="td-adspot-title">- Advertisement -</span><div style="text-align:center;"><broadstreet-zone zone-id="80034"></broadstreet-zone></div></div><h3>Foster a pet</h3><p>With all non-essential businesses shuttering for three weeks, the need for pet fosterers is greater than ever. And since most of us are either <a href="https://www.metroparent.com/daily/parenting/parenting-issues-tips/tips-to-work-from-home-with-kids-and-not-go-insane/">working from home</a> or off during that time, now&#8217;s the perfect time to foster a pet – and who knows, maybe you&#8217;ll have your new best friend when this is over.</p><p>Check with your local animal shelter or <a href="https://www.metroparent.com/daily/food-home/family-pet/pet-adoption-agencies-in-metro-detroit-and-ann-arbor/">pet adoption agency</a> for more information.</p><h3>Donate blood</h3><p>According to the <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html">American Red Cross</a>, there&#8217;s a severe blood shortage happening right now and healthy, eligible donors are strongly being urged to make an appointment.</p><p>You&#8217;re not staying at home for this one, but coronavirus is not known to spread through blood. The Red Cross is enforcing strong protocol to prevent the spread of the disease at blood donation spots.</p><h3>Create a community food pantry</h3><p>No doubt you&#8217;ve seen the Free Little Libraries around town. Have one in your community? Temporarily <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/488269-people-convert-book-sharing-libraries-into-mini-food-banks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">repurpose it</a> (or craft a new one) and fill it with your extra canned goods, toilet paper and other needed items and encourage your neighbors to add to it.</p><p>This way, when a community member runs out of something, they can adhere to CDC recommendations and keep away from others as they walk to your little food bank instead of hitting up a crowded market.</p><p><em>Pro-tip: COVID-19 can live up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Be cautious and use gloves when loading up your little pantries and make sure you&#8217;re sanitizing what you can.</em></p><h3>Host something fun online</h3><p>Know how to draw or bake? Host a <a href="https://www.metroparent.com/daily/family-fun/family-activities/virtual-classes-and-online-activities-for-kids/">virtual class</a> on Facebook Live and teach your community members a new skill. It&#8217;ll help keep them social, which is great for their mental health.</p><p>Don&#8217;t have a skill that translate well online? Grab a kids&#8217; book and offer to host a story time for their kids.</p><h3>Stay home</h3><p>It such a simple one but simply staying home can be one of the most beneficial things you can do for your community. Staying home helps slow the spread of the disease and will help keep our healthcare system from a huge influx of sick people.</p><p><em>Have you thought of any other ways we can help our community during the COVID crisis? Share them with us in the comments. </em></p></div><footer><div class="td-post-source-tags"></div><div class="td-block-row td-post-next-prev"><div class="td-block-span6 td-post-prev-post"><div class="td-post-next-prev-content"><span>Previous article</span><a href="https://www.metroparent.com/daily/health-fitness/coronavirus-help/carters-cantina-in-new-haven-collects-n95-masks-for-nurses/">Carter&#8217;s Cantina in New Haven Collects N95 Masks for Local Nurses</a></div></div><div class="td-next-prev-separator"></div><div class="td-block-span6 td-post-next-post"><div class="td-post-next-prev-content"><span>Next article</span><a href="https://www.metroparent.com/daily/food-home/home-care-maintenance/homemade-cleaning-products/">Homemade Cleaning Products to Help Fight Germs</a></div></div></div><div class="td-author-name vcard author" style="display: none"><span class="fn"><a href="https://www.metroparent.com/author/christinac1042/">Christina Clark</a></span></div> <span class="td-page-meta" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><meta itemprop="name" content="Christina Clark"></span><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2020-03-26T10:40:32-04:00"><meta itemprop="dateModified" content="2020-03-30T11:02:33-04:00"><meta itemscope itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" itemType="https://schema.org/WebPage" itemid="https://www.metroparent.com/daily/health-fitness/coronavirus-help/ways-to-help-out-your-community-at-home/"/><span class="td-page-meta" itemprop="publisher" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization"><span class="td-page-meta" itemprop="logo" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.metroparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/022320_WebLogo-Black-Orange.png"></span><meta itemprop="name" content="Detroit and Ann Arbor Metro Parent"></span><meta itemprop="headline " content="Ways to Help Out Your Community At Home"><span class="td-page-meta" itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.metroparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/how-to-help-your-community-at-home.jpeg"><meta itemprop="width" content="1200"><meta itemprop="height" content="718"></span></footer></article><div class="comments" id="comments"><div id="respond" class="comment-respond"><h3 id="reply-title" class="comment-reply-title">LEAVE A REPLY <small><a rel="nofollow" id="cancel-comment-reply-link" href="/daily/health-fitness/coronavirus-help/ways-to-help-out-your-community-at-home/#respond" style="display:none;">Cancel reply</a></small></h3><p class="must-log-in td-login-comment"><a class="td-login-modal-js" data-effect="mpf-td-login-effect" href="#login-form">Log in to leave a comment </a></p></div></div></div></div><div class="td-pb-span4 td-main-sidebar jabe" role="complementary"><div class="td-ss-main-sidebar"><div class="td-a-rec td-a-rec-id-custom_ad_1 tdi_74_744 td_block_template_1"><style>.tdi_74_744.td-a-rec-img,.tdi_74_744 .td-adspot-title{text-align:left}.tdi_74_744.td-a-rec-img img{margin:0 auto 0 0}.tdi_74_744 .td-element-style{z-index:-1}</style><broadstreet-zone zone-id="80033"></broadstreet-zone></div><aside id="custom_html-6" class="widget_text td_block_template_1 widget custom_html-6 widget_custom_html"><div class="textwidget custom-html-widget"><script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/v2.js"></script><script data-hubspot-rendered="true">hbspt.forms.create({
